# React Unicons - Monochrome Style

1000+ Pixel-perfect vector icons as React Components. These icons are designed by [Iconscout](https://iconscout.com).

## Getting Started
You can easily install [react-unicons](https://iconscout.com/unicons) using npm.
```bash
npm install --save @iconscout/react-unicons-monochrome
```
Or using `yarn`
```bash
yarn add @iconscout/react-unicons-monochrome
```

## Usage
### Use individual icons
```js
import React from 'react';
import UimReact from '@iconscout/react-unicons-monochrome/icons/uim-react'

const App = () => {
  return <UimReact size="140" color="#61DAFB" />
};

export default App;
````

You can customize icons as below:
```html
<Unicons.UimReact size="140" color="#61DAFB" />
```

### Usage as full Package
```js
import React from 'react';
import * as Unicons from '@iconscout/react-unicons-monochrome';
